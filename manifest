# Files to be copied to various directories. Work like:
# [directory where file lives in repo] [directory where file should go] [files]
files2copy[0]="HOME $HOME .testrc"

# This is an more realistic example
# Files to be copied from [HOME] to [$HOME]
# files2copy[0]="HOME $HOME .bashrc .profile .vimrc .gitconfig"
# Files to be copies from [HOME/vim] to [$HOME/.vim/plugin]
# files2copy[1]="HOME/vim $HOME/.vim/plugin gnupg.vim"

# Create directories
# I like to have an empty directory named 'sshfs' in my homedir for mounting sshfs.
